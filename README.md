# Credit-card-default-predictive-models

This project develops a classification model to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card. By analyzing key customer characteristics, we aim to help creditors make informed decisions about credit limits and risk management.

## Features of this Project
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and handling missing values  
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Applying techniques like oversampling/undersampling  
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and transforming relevant features  
- **Model Training:** Using machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measuring accuracy, recall, precision, and AUC-ROC
